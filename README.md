Tolulope Orelesi – Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio!
This website was created to showcase my work, projects, and experience as a Network Security Engineer. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I host it on GitHub Pages. The site also includes an interactive chatbot, smooth animations, and a QR code so people can access it quickly on their phones.

 What This Website Includes
1. Home & About Me

A short introduction about who I am, what I do, and what I’m passionate about in the field of network security.

2. Projects

A dedicated section that highlights some of the work I’ve done. Each project card includes:

A GitHub link to the source code

A Live Demo (when available)

A brief description of the project

3. Resume

You can view or download my resume directly from the website.
It includes my education, certifications, and technical skill set.

4. Chatbot

I added a custom chatbot to answer common questions about me, my projects, and my background.
It pops up at the bottom right corner of the screen and is fully interactive.

5. QR Code

The site generates a QR code that links directly to this portfolio so it can easily be accessed on mobile devices.
I also added it to my resume.

Technologies Used
